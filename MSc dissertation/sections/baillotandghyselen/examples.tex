Baillot and Ghyselen \cite{BaillotGhyselen2021} prove the soundness of their type system with respect to parallel complexity, using a subject reduction property and a safety property. The subject reduction property states that the reduction relation $\Longrightarrow$ is type-preserving, and is proved by induction on the rules defining $\Longrightarrow$. The safety property states that the index assigned to a well-typed process is an upper bound on the parallel complexity of the process, which follows from subject reduction and the definition of local complexity.

\begin{theorem}[Subject reduction]
If $\varphi;\Phi;\Gamma\vdash P \triangleleft K$ and $P \Rightarrow Q$ then $\varphi;\Phi;\Gamma\vdash Q \triangleleft K$.
\begin{proof}
By induction on the reduction rules defining $\Longrightarrow$ \cite{BaillotGhyselen2021}.
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Parallel complexity]
Let $P$ be an annotated process and $m$ be its parallel complexity. Then, for a typing $\varphi;\Phi;\Gamma\vdash P \triangleleft K$ we have that $\varphi;\Phi\vDash K \geq m$.
\begin{proof}
Follows from subject reduction and the definition of local complexity \cite{BaillotGhyselen2021}. 
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}
