\chapter{Type Systems for Parallel Complexity}\label{sec:typesyst}

Throughout this section, we represent type environments by the metavariables $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ as mappings defined by sequences of pairs $\Gamma = v_1 : T_1,v_2 : T_n,\dots,v_n : T_n$ where $v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n \in \mathbf{Var}$ are variables and $T_1,T_2,\dots,T_n$ are types, such that $\textit{dom}(\Gamma) = \{v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n\}$ and $\Gamma(v_i) = T_i$. We extend a type environment $\Gamma$ with a pair $v : T$ when $v \notin \textit{dom}(\Gamma)$ by writing $\Gamma, v : T$ such that $\textit{dom}(\Gamma, v : T) = \textit{dom}(\Gamma) \cup \{v\}$ and $(\Gamma, v : T)(v) = T$. We write the empty type environment as $\emptyset$. Types may differ for the different type systems, and are thus defined in each subsection.
