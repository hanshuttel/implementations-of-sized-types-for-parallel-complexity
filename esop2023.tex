%
Type systems using sized types have been studied extensively in the
context of complexity analysis of functional and parallel programs to
formally express, verify and infer complexity bounds on
programs. Recent contributions have extended this study to
message-passing processes using behavioral types to bound channel
synchronizations, providing a sound framework for parallel complexity
of pi-calculus processes. We explore the challenges of implementing
this work, and present a type checker and a type inference
algorithm. Our type checker can verify complexity analyses of some
polynomial- and linear time primitive recursive functions, encoded as
replicated channel inputs (servers), by using integer programming to
bound channel synchronizations. Comparison of parametric complexities
is a partial order, so to bound parallel complexities, we introduce
the notion of combined complexity: A set of intersecting parametric
complexity bounds. Our type inference algorithm first generates a
constraint satisfaction problem on sized input/output types that we
reduce to a set of polynomial inequality constraints, a solution to
which provides a parametric bound on the parallel complexity of a
server. We show how our constraint satisfaction problems can be
over-approximated and provide a Haskell implementation using the Z3
SMT solver that can provide reasonable bounds on the parallel
complexity of some linear time servers.
