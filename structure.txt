1. Introduction

- type inference and its main challenges
   (and why is it interesting?)
   - index polymorphism (why is it challenging? how did we solve
   this problem?)
   - related work
   - differences from existing work (esp. Hoffmann)
- limitations
   (undecidability of inference for partially annotated terms)
- this has even been implemented (how good is it? how did we evaluate
   the implementation?)

2. Pi-calculus (in our setting)   [can be gleaned from MSc thesis]

3. Our version of the B&G type system [can be gleaned from MSc thesis]
   - this is a simplified version
   - soundness results for the type system

4. Type inference [can the rules be simplified?]

   - the inference strategy
   - examples of using inference
   - discussion of the complexity (due to constraint solving)
   - undecidability for partially annotated terms

5. An implementation

   - short description of the implementation
   - how it was evaluated (benchmark as a set of processes to be analysed)

6. Related work (other than what was mentioned in Section 1)

7. Conclusion

   - comparisons with results of related work
