-- Structure of paper:

Introduction (2 pages)

	- examples of what BGs type system lead to (typings)
	- some related work

Pi-calculus (syntax and semantics) (< 3 pages)

Type system (3 pages) 

	- only essential rules

Inference of sized types for parallel complexity (5 pages)

	- return to example
	- implementation with example presented

Conclusion (< 1 page)

Appendix:
	
	- what can we use it for? (check FSCD guidelines)

---

Use "definition by example" as a principle when necessary (due to the page limit)

	- Candidate: Certain simplifications of constraints
	- Short explanation of how constraint judgements are verified
