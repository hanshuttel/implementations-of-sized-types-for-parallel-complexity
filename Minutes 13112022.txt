1. The implementation
2. The plan for further work


1. The problem with the implementation appears to be one related to division by zero (which is allowed by Z3!). Integer division appears in quantifier elimination.

2. We should finish the sections that are still not entirely complete. This means section 4 and the evaluation of the implementation. Only then should we trim the paper down to size. The full paper (which should be 25 to 30 pages) can become a technical report version that we can refer to in the short version.

As for the implementation, Mikkel and Thomas will update the implementation using Naoki's suggestion that division can be expressed as a double inequality:

z = x div y    iff  y * z <= x < (z+1) y

As for Section 4, we should find out which processes we should use for benchmarking. We choose an example from the paper by Baillot and Ghyselen â€“ and one that has linear time complexity. An example could be the toyfib process from their journal paper.

Mikkel and Thomas will encode the toyfib process.

When we meet again, we will discuss this example.

Hans will work on the section/subsection on related work.

We meet again on 19 November at 10:00 CET. We will discuss

- the toyfib example: Does it work for us? 
- the related work section
- how far are we from a 25-30 page full paper?
